# Finding pairs
Brute force is an invaluable technique that can be used to solve most bronze level problems. It involves searching all possible answers for the correct one. 

Consider the following problem:

*Given an array of numbers, output the indicies of the two distinct elements whose difference is exactly 10*

To solve this problem its useful to first understand how nested loops can be used to iterate over all possible pairs of numbers. Take a look at the following code:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
    //the values of i and j here will be every possible 2-number permutation of 0...n
  }
}
```
On the first iteration of the outer loop, `i` is set to 0. The inner loop runs and the value of `j` ranges between 0 and `n` whilst `i` is locked in at 0. On the second iteration of the outer loop, `i` is set to 1 and the inner loop sets `j` to every value between 0 and `n`. This way, for each iteration of the inner loop, the values of i and j  form every possible pair of numbers between 0 and `n`. More specifically, the values of i and j when `n` is set to 3 look like the following:

- 0,0
- 0,1
- 0,2
- 1,0
- 1,1
- 1,2
- 2,0
- 2,1
- 2,2

This is known as 'brute-forcing' each pair of numbers.

To solve the original problem we can brute force pairs of possible indicies in the array and check the corresponding array elements. This will, in effect, check every pair of array elements. When checking a pair of elements, we can compute their difference and if it is 10, we can output the pair of indicies. 


```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        //for every possible i and j, check wheather the elements at those indicies have a diff of 10
        if (abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) == 10) {      //using abs() to get absolute value distance
            cout << i << ' ' << j; //if so cout the indicies with a space in between
            return 0; //end the program by terminating main so we don't continue the search
        }
    }
}
```


## Farthest Two Points

Consider the following question:

*Given an array of coordinates, the problem of finding the farthest two points involves calculating the distances between all pairs of points and then selecting the maximum distance.*


We can use our knowledge of coordinate geometry along with brute forcing each pair of array elements.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 

using namespace std;

int distance(pair<int, int> A, pair<int, int> B) {   //a function that returns the distance between two points
    int dx = B.first - A.first;
    int dy = B.second - A.second;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

int farthestDistance(pair<int, int> points[], int n) {
    int maxDist = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            int dist = distance(points[i], points[j]);
            maxDist = max(maxDist, dist);
        }
    }
    return maxDist;
}

int main() {
    pair<int, int> points[] = {make_pair(1, 2), make_pair(4, 6), make_pair(7, 8)};
    int n = sizeof(points) / sizeof(points[0]);

    int maxDist = farthestDistance(points, n);
    cout << "Farthest distance between points: " << maxDist << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
