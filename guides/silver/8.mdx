# Ad-Hoc

Many problems you will encounter in your Competitive Programming journey will be Ad-Hoc Problems.

These are problems with ideas that do not fall into **standard categories** and instead, require you to produce **new and creative** solutions to tackle the problem.
It may not come as a surprise that a lot of problems may be classified as Ad-Hoc. They generally may be quite difficult to deal with due to their *unknown* nature. Here are some tips on how you can tackle them.

1. Read the problem carefully and think about it for a bit.
2. Write out some small sample cases and solve them manually. It is quite likely that the way you solve them manually is the approach in the solution.
3. Make some key observations or lemma. Again, you will only get this by tinkering around and understanding the problem.
4. Once you feel you have an approach, think formally and in code about how you will implement it.

<ExerciseQuestion>

Given two positive integers, <Math inline> x, y </Math>, (1 <= **x, y** <= <Math inline> 2 * 10^5 </Math>) find out whether or not they are *relatively prime*.

**Note**:

Two integers, <Math inline> x, y </Math> are relatively prime if and only if the **only** factor they share is 1.

#Input:

Two integers, <Math inline>x, y</Math> respectively. (1 <= **x, y** <= <Math inline> 2 * 10^5 </Math>)

#Output:

Print **'YES'** (without quotes) if x and y are relatively prime, otherwise, print 'NO' (without quotes).

</ExerciseQuestion>

<ExerciseAnswer>

#Solution:

Since the problem talks about factors and integers, a natural thought may be to find the factors of <Math inline> x and y </Math>. To re-iterate, try whatever comes to mind, one approach may be correct.

We will store the factors of both x and y in two *integer arrays*. Now the question arises, how would we find their factors.
Since both x and y are relatively small, it suffices to find their factors in <Math inline>O(n)</Math>, i.e, linear time. We can run for loops from 1 to x (same with y) and if x % i == 0 (i.e, the remainder of x and i is 0),
we add i to the array for the factors of x. We do the same with y. (To optimize, you may run the for loop from 1 to $\sqrt{x}$ and when x % i == 0, add both i and x//i)

What remains is to figure out if x and y share only 1 as a common factor. You can do this by taking the intersection of both the arrays. The intersection essentially only leaves the elements common to both
sets, and for x and y to be relatively prime, the intersection must share only one element, i.e., 1. So, we do factorsx.intersection(factors) and check if the length is 1.

```python
x, y = map(int,input().split()))
factorsx,factorsy = [],[]

for i in range(1,x+1):
    if x % i == 0:
        factorsx.append(i)

for i in range(1,y+1):
    if y % i == 0:
        factorsy.append(i)

if len(set(factorsx).intersection(set(factorsy))) == 1:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

```
