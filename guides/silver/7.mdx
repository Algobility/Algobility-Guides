Sorting is the process of taking an array and rearranging the elements such that they are ordered in ascending or descending order. C++ provides us with a built-in function that can sort an array. While the silver rank doesn't require you to understand the logic for how sorting works under the hood, readers are encouraged to take a look at the following resources to understand how sorting is done by the built-in function `sort()` in <Math inline>O(nlogn)</Math>.

# Sorting a simple array

To sort an array `arr`, use `sort(arr, arr + n)` where `n` is the number of elements to be sorted. By default, the `sort()` function sorts an array in ascending order. 

Note: `sort()` modifies the array passed in instead of simply returning a sorted version of it.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>    
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = { 2,4,2,5,2,3 };
    sort(arr, arr + 6);
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << ' ';
    }
}
```

The following code outputs

```text
2 2 2 3 4 5 
```

<ExerciseQuestion>
Given an array of size <Math inline>n</Math>, list out the 3 largest elements it contains. It is given that <Math inline>n>2</Math>. The first line of input will contain the value of <Math inline>n</Math>. The second line will contain <Math inline>n</Math>, space-seperated, integers representing the elements of the array. Output the 3 largest elements in ascending order, seperated by spaces.

To solve this problem, we can simply sort the array in ascending order and then print out the last 3 elements of the modified array.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>    
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n; cin >> n;
    int arr[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    sort(arr, arr + n);
    for (int i = n - 3; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << ' ';
    }
}
```

# Sorting vectors
Sorting vectors isn't much different. Simply use `sort(v.begin(), v.end())` (or `sort(begin(v),end(v))`). The default sort function sorts the array in ascending order. 

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<int> v{1, 3, 3, 120, 4};
	sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    //v is now sorted
}
```


# Sorting as a problem-solving technique
Sorting often can be used to cleverly reduce the time complexity of brute-force algorithms. For example, imagine you need to check if an array contains duplicates. One way to do this would be to brute force all pairs of elements in the array and checking if the two elements have the same values. If they do, a duplicate must exist. However this would take <Math inline>O(n^2)</Math> time (where `n` is the size of the array). 

Sorting allows us to create an algorithm with a much faster time complexity. If we sort the array, duplicate numbers will appear next to each other. Thus, all we have to do after sorting the array is to traverse it and make sure that no element is such that it has the same value as the next element in the sorted array. If no such element exists, there must be no duplicate. Since sorting takes <Math inline>O(nlogn)</Math> and traversing over the array takes <Math inline>O(n)</Math> the total time complexity of the algorithm is <Math inline>O(nlogn + n)</Math> which is the same as <Math inline>O(nlogn)</Math> in Big-O notation.   

Note: In this case, the sets would  would be to insert all the elements of the array into a set and then checking if the set size is less than the array size. Since insertion in sets takes <Math inline>O(logn)</Math> time, inserting all elements one by one would take <Math inline>O(nlogn)</Math>. This is faster than the first approach but we can do better with sorting. If the array
