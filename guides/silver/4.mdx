Coordinate geometry is a fundamental concept in mathematics that involves understanding the relationships between points on a plane using their numerical coordinates. In competitive programming, coordinate geometry is often used to solve problems involving points, lines, and shapes in a two-dimensional space. This guide will walk you through the basics of coordinate geometry using C++ and show you how to tackle common problems like finding the farthest two points, calculating the area of a rectangle, and checking for collision between rectangles.


# Using std::pair for Coordinates

In C++, the `std::pair` data type can be used to represent a coordinate point neatly. It's a convenient way to store and manipulate coordinates together. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility> // Include the utility header for std::pair

using namespace std;

int main() {
    pair<int, int> point1 = make_pair(3, 5);
    cout << "Point 1: (" << point1.first << ", " << point1.second << ")" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

# Distance between Two Points

To calculate the distance between two points `A(x1, y1)` and `B(x2, y2)`, you can use the distance formula:

```text
distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
```

This formula is based on the Pythagorean theorem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // Include the math header for sqrt
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

double distance(pair<int, int> A, pair<int, int> B) {
    int dx = B.first - A.first;
    int dy = B.second - A.second;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

int main() {
    pair<int, int> point1 = make_pair(1, 2);
    pair<int, int> point2 = make_pair(4, 6);

    double dist = distance(point1, point2);
    cout << "Distance between points: " << dist << endl;

    return 0;
}
```


# Area of a Rectangle

Given coordinates of two opposite corners `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` of a rectangle, you can calculate its area using the formula:

```cpp
area = abs(x2 - x1) * abs(y2 - y1)
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

int rectangleArea(pair<int, int> A, pair<int, int> B) {
    int width = abs(B.first - A.first);
    int height = abs(B.second - A.second);
    return width * height;
}

int main() {
    pair<int, int> corner1 = make_pair(1, 2);
    pair<int, int> corner2 = make_pair(5, 5);

    int area = rectangleArea(corner1, corner2);
    cout << "Rectangle area: " << area << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

# Checking Rectangle Collision

To check if two rectangles are colliding, compare their x and y ranges. If the x-range and y-range of one rectangle overlap with the x-range and y-range of the other rectangle, then they are colliding.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

bool isColliding(pair<int, int> A1, pair<int, int> A2, pair<int, int> B1, pair<int, int> B2) {
    bool xOverlap = (A1.first <= B2.first && B1.first <= A2.first);
    bool yOverlap = (A1.second <= B2.second && B1.second <= A2.second);
    return xOverlap && yOverlap;
}

int main() {
    pair<int, int> rect1A = make_pair(1, 2);
    pair<int, int> rect1B = make_pair(4, 5);
    pair<int, int> rect2A = make_pair(3, 4);
    pair<int, int> rect2B = make_pair(6, 7);

    bool colliding = isColliding(rect1A, rect1B, rect2A, rect2B);
    if (colliding)
        cout << "Rectangles are colliding." << endl;
    else
        cout << "Rectangles are not colliding." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
