# Trees  

A **connected component** in a graph is a subset of nodes such that there is a path between any two nodes in this subset, and no additional node outside this subset is connected to them. In simple terms, a connected component is a group of nodes that are reachable from each other.  

The following graph has three connected components highlighted in different colors

A **tree** is a special type of graph that consists of exactly one connected component and contains no cycles. This means that a tree is a connected, acyclic graph. The absence of cycles ensures that there is only one way to travel between any two nodes, and the connectivity guarantees that no node is isolated.  

# Properties of Trees  

Since a tree is connected and has no cycles, it follows a few useful properties:

1. A tree with `N` nodes always has exactly `N - 1` edges. This can be understood by thinking about how a tree is constructed. If we start with a single node and add edges one by one while maintaining connectivity and avoiding cycles, every new edge must connect a new node to the existing structure. This process must stop at `N - 1` edges because adding an extra edge would create a cycle.  
2. There is exactly **one simple path** between any two nodes in a tree. A simple path is a path that does not repeat any node. Since a tree is connected, there must be at least one path between any two nodes. However, if there were multiple paths between two nodes, a cycle would exist, which contradicts the definition of a tree. This property is particularly useful when solving problems involving distances or finding paths in trees.  


# Tree Terminology  

Understanding the terminology used in trees is essential for solving problems efficiently.  

- **Rooted Tree**: A tree in which one node is designated as the root, and all other nodes are structured hierarchically. This is useful in problems where parent-child relationships are important.  The example tree below is rooted at A.
- **Parent and Child**: In a rooted tree, if a node `u` is directly connected to a node `v` such that `u` is closer to the root, then `u` is the parent of `v`, and `v` is the child of `u`.  In the example below, A is the parent of B. The children of B are D and  E. 
- **Leaf Node**: A node with no children. In an undirected tree, these are the nodes with only one edge.  In the example below, these are highlighted in blue.
- **Depth of a Node**: The distance from the root to that node, usually counted as the number of edges.  
- **Height of a Tree**: The maximum depth of any node in the tree.  The example below shows a tree of height 4
- **Subtree**: The portion of the tree rooted at a particular node, including all of its descendants.

# Tree Traversal

Like any other graph, trees can be traversed using DFS and BFS. When traversing a tree with BFS, the tree will be traversed one layer at a time. First the root will be visited, then all the nodes with a depth of 1 will be visited, then all the nodes with a depth of 2, and so on. With DFS, a singular branch (a path from the root to one leaf node) will be first completely traversed before another branch. 


# Example Tree Problem

Consider the following problem:
*You are given a tree with `N` nodes. Each node has a value assigned to it. Your task is to answer `Q` queries of the following type: Given a node `u`, find the sum of all node values in the subtree rooted at `u`.

To efficiently compute subtree sums, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) with preprocessing. The key idea is to compute the subtree sum for every node in a single DFS traversal and store it in an array. Since each query only requires looking up a precomputed value, it can be answered in **O(1)** time.  

# Solution Approach  

1. **Graph Construction**: The adjacency list is built from input edges.  
2. **DFS Traversal**:  
   - The `subtree_sum` of each node starts as its own value.  
   - The DFS recursively computes subtree sums by accumulating values from child nodes.  
3. **Query Processing**: Each query is answered instantly using the precomputed `subtree_sum` array.  

# Implementation  

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100000;
vector<int> adj[MAXN + 1]; 
int subtree_sum[MAXN + 1];  
int values[MAXN + 1];  

void dfs(int node, int parent) {
    subtree_sum[node] = values[node];  
    for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (neighbor == parent) continue;  
        dfs(neighbor, node);
        subtree_sum[node] += subtree_sum[neighbor];  
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n, q;
    cin >> n;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cin >> values[i];  

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    dfs(1, -1);  

    cin >> q;
    while (q--) {
        int u;
        cin >> u;
        cout << subtree_sum[u] << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```


# Complexity Analysis  

The DFS Traversal takes <Math inline>O(N)</Math> since each node is visited once. Each query is then processed in <Math inline>O(1)</Math> time. This is repeated for `Q` queries. Thus, the time complexity for answering all queries is <Math inline>O(Q)</Math>. The total time complexity for our entire algorithm, therefore, is <Math inline>O(N+!)</Math>
