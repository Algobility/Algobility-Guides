Many problems will require you to process a grid-like structure as input. The input for such problems often looks something like,

```text
XXOOXX
X0XX00
X000XX
```

or 

```text
.#...#
....##
##....
#..##.
#.#..#
#.....
```



Flood fill is an algorithm used to explore and mark connected components in a grid. It is commonly used for solving problems that involve filling regions, counting distinct areas, or finding paths in grid-based problems.  

# Understanding Grids  

A grid can be thought of as a graph where each cell represents a node, and edges exist between adjacent cells. The most common type is a **2D grid**, where each cell has up to four neighbors: up, down, left, and right. Some problems may also consider diagonal movement, increasing the number of neighbors to eight.  

A grid can be represented in multiple ways, but the most common representation is a **matrix**. For a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns, it can be stored as a `n × m` array where `grid[i][j]` refers to the cell at row `i` and column `j`.  

# Movement in a Grid  

To traverse a grid, we define possible moves as changes in row and column values. If only four-directional movement is allowed, the possible moves can be represented as:  

```text
dx = {-1, 1,  0, 0}
dy = { 0, 0, -1, 1}
```

Each `(dx[k], dy[k])` pair represents movement in one direction:  
- `(-1, 0)`: Move **up**  
- `(1, 0)`: Move **down**  
- `(0, -1)`: Move **left**  
- `(0, 1)`: Move **right**  

If diagonal movement is allowed, additional directions are included:  

```text
dx = {-1, -1, -1,  0, 0,  1, 1, 1}
dy = {-1,  0,  1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 1}
```

# Flood Fill Algorithm  

Flood fill is a modified graph traversal algorithm used to explore all connected cells in a grid. It works by visiting a starting cell and recursively spreading to all valid neighboring cells. This is similar to exploring a connected component in a general graph.  

Flood fill can be implemented using either DFS or BFS:  

1. **DFS approach**:  
   - Start at a given cell and mark it as visited.  
   - Recursively visit all valid neighbors.  

2. **BFS approach**:  
   - Start at a given cell and push it into a queue.  
   - Process each cell by marking it and adding all valid neighbors to the queue.  

# Example Problem  

Given a grid of size `n × m` consisting of `.` and `#`, count the number of connected components formed by `.`. Two `.` cells are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.  

Example input:  

```text
.#..#.
...##.
.####.
.#.#..
##..#.
```

This grid has 3 connected components formed by `.`.

# Solution


To solve this problem, we need to find all connected components of `.` in the given grid. Since a connected component is defined as a group of `.` cells that are adjacent either horizontally or vertically, we can use flood fill to mark and count these regions.  

The approach consists of the following steps:  

1. Read the input grid into a 2D array.  
2. Initialize a `visited` array to keep track of which cells have already been processed.  
3. Iterate over all cells in the grid. If a cell contains `.` and has not been visited, this means a new connected component has been found.  
4. Perform a flood fill from this cell using DFS, marking all reachable `.` cells as visited.  
5. Repeat the process for all unvisited `.` cells and count the number of times a new component is found.  

Note that using BFS for this implementation would have also worked. Choosing between BFS and DFS in such problems comes down to which ever you find easier to code.  

Below is the implementation of this solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
vector<string> grid;
vector<vector<bool>> visited;

int dx[] = {-1, 1,  0, 0};
int dy[] = { 0, 0, -1, 1};

void dfs(int x, int y) {
    visited[x][y] = true;

    for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
        int nx = x + dx[k], ny = y + dy[k];

        if (nx >= 0 && nx < n && ny >= 0 && ny < m && !visited[nx][ny] && grid[nx][ny] == '.') {
            dfs(nx, ny);
        }
    }
}

int countComponents() {
    visited.assign(n, vector<bool>(m, false));
    int components = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '.' && !visited[i][j]) {
                dfs(i, j);
                components++;
            }
        }
    }

    return components;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    grid.resize(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> grid[i];
    }

    cout << countComponents() << endl;
}
```
