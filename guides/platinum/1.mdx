In computer science, a graph is a way to represent data in terms of entities, called nodes, and connections between them, called edges. This representation of relationships between different entities is quite versatile and has a wide range of applications, from representing social networks to transportation systems.

Note: A graph in computer sciecne should not be confused with the usual meaning of graphs in the context of mathematics 

An example of the graph data structure would be a representation of a simple social network with users as nodes and friendship connections as edges. Here's what it might look like:

In this graph, "Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "Dave", and "Edgar" are nodes, and the lines connecting them represent the connections (friendships) between them.

Graphs can take various forms, depending on the nature of their edges and nodes. Here are some common types you may encounter

# Undirected Graphs:


In an undirected graph, edges have no direction, meaning they don't have a specific start or end point. They simply connect two nodes.

The social network graph mentioned earlier is an undirected graph. The friendships between users are mutual, meaning if Alice is friends with Bob, Bob is also friends with Alice.

# Directed Graph (Digraph):

In a directed graph, edges have a direction, indicating that they go from one node to another. They are often used to represent relationships with a specific direction.


Imagine a directed graph that represents flight routes between different cities. This graph shows the one-way flight connections from one city to another:

<Figure src='/guide_images/flights.png' classExtensions={"w-1/2"}/>


In this travel graph, the arrows indicate the direction of the flights. For instance, you can fly from New York to Miami, but there's no direct flight from Miami back to New York. It's a simplified example, but it illustrates the concept of a directed graph with real-world travel connections.


# Weighted Graph:

In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. These weights can represent distances, costs, or any other relevant metric.

Imagine a graph that models a road network, with cities as nodes and the distances between them as weights on the edges.

<Figure src='/guide_images/distances.png' classExtensions={"w-1/2"}/>

The numbers next to the arrows represent the distances between cities, making this a weighted graph. A weighted graph may be directed or undirected.


# Cyclic and Acyclic Graph:

A graph is **cyclic** if it contains at least one cycle, i.e., a path that starts and ends at the same node. In contrast, an acyclic graph has no cycles.

A university curriculum can be represented as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from **A â†’ B** indicates that course **A** must be completed before taking course **B**.

<Figure src='/guide_images/courses.png' classExtensions='w-1/2'/>

- Math 101 is a prerequisite for both Math 102 and Physics 101.
- There are no cycles since a course cannot be a prerequisite for itself, nor can it be a prerequisite for a course that is a prerequisite for itself.

This structure ensures a clear progression, making it **acyclic**.
