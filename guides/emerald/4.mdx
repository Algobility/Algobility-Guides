# Motivation  

Suppose we have a set of `n` tasks, where some tasks must be completed before others. Our goal is to find an ordering of tasks that respects these dependencies.  

For example, consider the following dependency list:  

- Task `A` must be completed before task `B`.  
- Task `A` must be completed before task `C`.  
- Task `B` must be completed before task `D`.  
- Task `C` must be completed before task `D`.  

A valid order to complete the tasks would be `A → B → C → D` or `A → C → B → D`.  

This problem can be represented as a **directed graph**, where each node is a task, and a directed edge `u → v` means `u` must be completed before `v`. The solution to this problem is called a **topological sorting** of the graph.  

# Definition  

A **topological sort** of a directed graph is an ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge `u → v`, node `u` appears **before** node `v` in the ordering.  

A valid topological sort exists **only if the graph has no cycles**. If there is a cycle, at least one task depends on itself indirectly, making it impossible to complete all tasks.  

For example, in the following directed graph:  

```
    A → B → D  
    ↓    ↘  
    C →  E  
```

One valid topological order is: `A → C → B → E → D`. Another valid order is `A → B → C → E → D`.  

However, if we introduce an edge `D → A`, we get a cycle (`A → B → D → A`), and no valid topological order exists.  

# Approaches to Topological Sorting  

There are two main algorithms for computing a topological sort:  

1. **Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS-based approach)** – Uses an **in-degree** array to iteratively select nodes with no incoming edges.  
2. **DFS-based approach** – Uses a depth-first search and stores nodes in reverse postorder.  

Both methods produce a valid topological ordering if the graph is acyclic. If the graph has a cycle, neither method can produce a valid ordering.

# Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS-Based Approach)  

Kahn’s algorithm is a method to generate a **topological ordering** of a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** using a **breadth-first search (BFS) approach**. Instead of processing nodes in an arbitrary order, it ensures that each node appears **only after all its prerequisites** have been processed.  

# Core Idea  

Every node in the graph has an **in-degree**, which represents the number of edges pointing **toward** it. If a node has an in-degree of `0`, it means **no other node depends on it**, so it can be safely placed at the beginning of the topological order.  

Kahn’s algorithm works by repeatedly selecting nodes with `in-degree = 0`, placing them in the topological order, and reducing the in-degree of their neighbors. This continues until all nodes are processed.  

# Step-by-Step Example  

Consider the following directed graph:  

```
    A → B → D  
    ↓    ↘  
    C →  E  
```  

### Step 1: Compute In-Degrees  

First, we calculate the **in-degree** of each node by counting how many edges point toward it:  

```
A: 0  
B: 1 (A → B)  
C: 1 (A → C)  
D: 1 (B → D)  
E: 2 (C → E, B → E)  
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Queue  

We place all nodes with `in-degree = 0` into a queue since they have no dependencies and can be processed immediately.  

**Queue:** `[A]`  

### Step 3: Process Nodes  

#### Process `A`:  
- Add `A` to the topological order.  
- Reduce the in-degree of `B` and `C` (since `A → B` and `A → C`).  

Updated in-degrees:  
```
B: 0  
C: 0  
D: 1  
E: 2  
```

**Queue:** `[B, C]`  
**Order:** `[A]`  

#### Process `B`:  
- Add `B` to the order.  
- Reduce the in-degree of `D` and `E` (since `B → D` and `B → E`).  

Updated in-degrees:  
```
C: 0  
D: 0  
E: 1  
```

**Queue:** `[C, D]`  
**Order:** `[A, B]`  

#### Process `C`:  
- Add `C` to the order.  
- Reduce the in-degree of `E` (since `C → E`).  

Updated in-degrees:  
```
D: 0  
E: 0  
```

**Queue:** `[D, E]`  
**Order:** `[A, B, C]`  

#### Process `D`:  
- Add `D` to the order.  
- `D` has no outgoing edges, so nothing changes.  

**Queue:** `[E]`  
**Order:** `[A, B, C, D]`  

#### Process `E`:  
- Add `E` to the order.  
- `E` has no outgoing edges.  

**Queue:** `[]`  
**Order:** `[A, B, C, D, E]`  

Since all nodes are processed, the final **topological order** is:  

```
A → B → C → D → E
```

# General Algorithm  

1. **Compute the in-degree** of each node.  
2. **Add all nodes with in-degree `0`** to a queue.  
3. **Process nodes one by one** from the queue:  
   - Add the node to the topological order.  
   - Reduce the in-degree of all its neighbors.  
   - If any neighbor’s in-degree becomes `0`, add it to the queue.  
4. **If all nodes are processed, we have a valid order**.  

If there are still nodes left unprocessed, this means the graph contains a cycle, and **a topological order does not exist**.  

# Implementation  

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int N = 100005;
vector<int> adj[N];
int in_degree[N];

vector<int> topological_sort(int n) {
    queue<int> q;
    vector<int> order;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (in_degree[i] == 0) {
            q.push(i);
        }
    }

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        order.push_back(node);

        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            in_degree[neighbor]--;
            if (in_degree[neighbor] == 0) {
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    if (order.size() < n) {
        return {}; // Cycle detected
    }

    return order;
}
```

This implementation ensures that nodes appear **only after their dependencies**, making it an efficient and reliable method for **topological sorting**.
