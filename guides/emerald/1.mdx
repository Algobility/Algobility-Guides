Finding the shortest path in a graph is one of the most fundamental problems in graph theory. There are multiple algorithms to solve it, each optimized for different graph types and constraints. One of the most efficient algorithms for graphs with non-negative edge weights is Dijkstra's Algorithm. It finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

# Dijkstra’s Algorithm 

The core idea behind Dijkstra’s algorithm is to expand the shortest known paths incrementally, ensuring that every time a node is marked as "processed," the shortest path to that node has already been found. The algorithm relies on a greedy approach—always expanding the nearest unvisited node—and a priority queue to efficiently retrieve the next node to process. 

Dijkstra's algorithm follows these steps:

1. Initialize distances: Set the distance to the source node as 0 and all other nodes as ∞ (infinity). This represents the fact that initially, we don’t know any paths to those nodes.
2. Use a priority queue (min-heap): The algorithm maintains a priority queue where each node is prioritized based on its current shortest known distance.
3. Process the nearest unvisited node: Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue. This guarantees that the shortest path to this node has been found.
4. Update neighboring nodes: For each neighboring node of the current node, calculate the new possible shortest distance.If this new distance is smaller than the previously known distance, update it and push the node into the priority queue.
7. Repeat until all nodes are processed (until priority queue is empty or until all reachable nodes have been assigned their shortest path distance )

Each step ensures that distances are updated optimally, guaranteeing correctness. The key to Dijkstra’s efficiency is its use of a priority queue, which allows fast retrieval of the next node to process.


# Example Walkthrough  

Consider a graph with 5 nodes and the following weighted edges:  

<Figure src='/guide_images/dijk.png' classExtensions='w-1/2' />

We will run Dijkstra’s algorithm from node `1`, computing the shortest distance to all other nodes.  

## Step 1: Initialization

Initially, all nodes will have a distance of infinity from our source node (node `1`) 

```text
Node  Distance  Previous Node  
1     0         -  
2     ∞         -  
3     ∞         -  
4     ∞         -  
5     ∞         -  
```

The priority queue contains `{ (0,1) }` (node `1` is inserted with distance `0`).  

## Step 2: Process Node 1  

Remove `(0,1)` from the priority queue.  

Update neighbors:  
- `2` is reachable via `1 → 2` (cost `4`), update `dist[2] = 4`.  
- `3` is reachable via `1 → 3` (cost `1`), update `dist[3] = 1`.  

```text
Node  Distance  Previous Node  
1     0         -  
2     4         1  
3     1         1  
4     ∞         -  
5     ∞         -  
```

Priority queue: `{ (1,3), (4,2) }`. Node `3` has the smallest distance, so it will be processed next.  

## Step 3: Process Node 3  

Remove `(1,3)` from the priority queue.  

Update neighbors:  
- `2` is reachable via `3 → 2` (cost `1 + 2 = 3`), update `dist[2] = 3` (was `4`).  
- `4` is reachable via `3 → 4` (cost `1 + 5 = 6`), update `dist[4] = 6`.  

```text
Node  Distance  Previous Node  
1     0         -  
2     3         3  
3     1         1  
4     6         3  
5     ∞         -  
```

Priority queue: `{ (3,2), (4,2), (6,4) }`. Node `2` with distance `3` is processed next.  

## Step 4: Process Node 2  

Remove `(3,2)` from the priority queue.  

Update neighbors:  
- `4` is reachable via `2 → 4` (cost `3 + 3 = 6`), but `dist[4]` is already `6`, so no update needed.  

```text
Node  Distance  Previous Node  
1     0         -  
2     3         3  
3     1         1  
4     6         3  
5     ∞         -  
```

Priority queue: `{ (4,2), (6,4) }`. Node `4` is next.  

## Step 5: Process Node 4  

Remove `(6,4)` from the priority queue.  

Update neighbors:  
- `5` is reachable via `4 → 5` (cost `6 + 1 = 7`), update `dist[5] = 7`.  

```text
Node  Distance  Previous Node  
1     0         -  
2     3         3  
3     1         1  
4     6         3  
5     7         4  
```

Priority queue: `{ (7,5) }`. Node `5` is next.  

## Step 6: Process Node 5  

Remove `(7,5)` from the priority queue.  

There are now no more neighbors to update.  The Final shortest distances from node `1` are:  

```text
Node  Distance  Previous Node  
1     0         -  
2     3         3  
3     1         1  
4     6         3  
5     7         4  
```


# Example Problem

Consider the Following Problem

*You are given a country with `n` cities and `m` bidirectional roads. Each road connects two cities and has a certain travel cost. You start in city `1` and need to reach city `n`. However, there is an additional rule: after visiting any city, you must pay a fixed toll cost unique to that city (including the starting city). Find the minimum total cost to travel from city `1` to city `n`, including all toll costs along the way.*

# Solution Explanation  

This problem is a modified version of the shortest path problem. Normally, Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path by only considering edge weights. However, here, we must also account for toll costs at each city.  

The key observation is that we can transform the problem into a standard shortest path problem by treating the **effective cost** of reaching a city as:  distance to city + toll cost of that city

This means that when updating distances in Dijkstra’s algorithm, instead of simply considering the edge cost `w`, we must add the toll cost of the destination city.  

# Implementation  

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long  

const int INF = 1e18;

int32_t main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    vector<int> toll(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> toll[i];
    }

    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int u, v, w;
        cin >> u >> v >> w;
        adj[u].push_back({v, w});
        adj[v].push_back({u, w});
    }

    // Dijkstra's Algorithm
    vector<int> dist(n + 1, INF);
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;

    dist[1] = toll[1];
    pq.push({dist[1], 1});

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [cur_cost, u] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();

        if (cur_cost > dist[u]) continue;

        for (auto [v, w] : adj[u]) {
            int new_cost = cur_cost + w + toll[v];
            if (new_cost < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = new_cost;
                pq.push({new_cost, v});
            }
        }
    }

    cout << dist[n] << "\n";
}
```  

# Complexity Analysis  

- Each node is processed once, and each edge is relaxed at most once, leading to a time complexity of <Math inline>O((n+m) log n )</Math> due to the priority queue operations.  
- The space complexity is <Math inline>O(n+m)</Math>  for storing the graph and distances.
