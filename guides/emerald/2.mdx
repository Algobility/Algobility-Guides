# Motivation  

Suppose we are given `n` elements, initially in separate groups, and we need to process `m` queries of the following two types:  

1. **Merge** the groups containing `x` and `y`.  
2. **Check** if `x` and `y` belong to the same group.  

A naive approach would be to maintain a list for each group and merge lists whenever a new connection is formed. However, this approach would be inefficient, as merging two lists of sizes `a` and `b` takes `O(a + b)` time, making worst-case operations take `O(n²)`.  

Instead, we can use a **Union-Find Disjoint Set (UFDS)**, also known as **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**, to efficiently manage these groups. This data structure allows us to merge two groups and check membership in **near constant time**.  

# Basic Structure  

Each element belongs to a set, and every set has a **representative** element, called the **leader** or **root**. Initially, each element is its own leader, meaning we start with `n` separate sets.  

To implement this, we maintain an array `parent[]`, where `parent[i]` stores the parent of `i`. If `parent[i] == i`, then `i` is the leader of its set.  

For example, if we have `n = 5` elements, the initial state is:  

```
Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
Parent:   0  1  2  3  4  (each element is its own leader)
```

# Find Operation  

To determine which set an element belongs to, we keep moving up the parent chain until we reach the root. This is the leader of the set.  

```cpp
int find(int x) {
    if (parent[x] == x) return x; // x is the leader
    return find(parent[x]); // Move up the tree
}
```  

### Example  

Suppose we have the following structure after merging some elements:  

```
Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
Parent:   0  0  2  2  4  
```

- `find(1)` → `parent[1] = 0`, so we call `find(0)`, which returns `0`.  
- `find(3)` → `parent[3] = 2`, so we call `find(2)`, which returns `2`.  

This implementation works, but if the tree becomes too deep, `find(x)` can take **O(n) time** in the worst case.  

# Union Operation  

To merge two sets, we find their leaders and make one leader the parent of the other.  

```cpp
void unite(int x, int y) {
    int leaderX = find(x);
    int leaderY = find(y);
    if (leaderX != leaderY) {
        parent[leaderY] = leaderX; // Merge sets
    }
}
```

### Example  

Initially, all elements are separate:  

```
Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
Parent:   0  1  2  3  4  
```

1. **`unite(0, 1)`**  
   - `find(0) = 0`, `find(1) = 1`  
   - We set `parent[1] = 0`  
   ```
   Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
   Parent:   0  0  2  3  4  
   ```

2. **`unite(3, 4)`**  
   - `find(3) = 3`, `find(4) = 4`  
   - We set `parent[4] = 3`  
   ```
   Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
   Parent:   0  0  2  3  3  
   ```

3. **`unite(1, 4)`**  
   - `find(1) = 0`, `find(4) = 3`  
   - We set `parent[3] = 0`  
   ```
   Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
   Parent:   0  0  2  0  3  
   ```

Now, `find(4)` would go from `4 → 3 → 0`, showing that `4` and `1` are connected.
# Path Compression  

In our current implementation, the `find(x)` function repeatedly follows parent pointers until it reaches the leader. However, this can create long chains of parent pointers, leading to inefficient queries.  

For example, after performing some `unite` operations, we might end up with the following structure:  

```
Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
Parent:   0  0  2  2  3  
```

If we call `find(4)`, the sequence of calls is:  

```
find(4) → parent[4] = 3 → find(3) → parent[3] = 2 → find(2) = 2  
```

This requires multiple recursive calls. Instead, we can optimize `find(x)` using **path compression**, which shortens the path by directly connecting every node along the way to the leader.  

# Optimized Find with Path Compression  

Instead of returning `find(parent[x])` directly, we update `parent[x]` to be the leader of the set.  

```cpp
int find(int x) {
    if (parent[x] == x) return x;
    return parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
}
```

With this change, whenever we call `find(x)`, every node along the path will now directly point to the leader.  

### Example  

If we call `find(4)`, the calls proceed as follows:  

```
find(4) → parent[4] = 3 → find(3) → parent[3] = 2 → find(2) = 2  
```

After path compression, `parent[4]` and `parent[3]` are directly set to `2`, giving us:  

```
Index:    0  1  2  3  4  
Parent:   0  0  2  2  2  
```

Now, future `find(4)` calls return `2` in a single step.  

# Effect of Path Compression  

Path compression significantly reduces the height of the trees. In the worst case, without compression, the tree can become **linear**, leading to `O(n)` `find(x)`. With path compression, the time complexity reduces to **O(α(n))**, where **α(n)** is the **inverse Ackermann function**, which grows extremely slowly. For all practical inputs, `α(n) ≤ 5`, making operations **almost constant time**.  

# Complete Implementation  

With path compression included, the full implementation is:  

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int N = 100005;
int parent[N];

void init(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = i;
}

int find(int x) {
    if (parent[x] == x) return x;
    return parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
}

void unite(int x, int y) {
    int leaderX = find(x);
    int leaderY = find(y);
    if (leaderX != leaderY) {
        parent[leaderY] = leaderX;
    }
}
```

This implementation allows merging and finding sets in nearly constant time. However, even with path compression, `unite(x, y)` might still create unbalanced trees. To address this, we can use **union by rank**, which ensures smaller trees always attach under larger ones.
